# Frontend Challenge Starter Template

This is my starting point for all Frontend Challenges.

## How to use

## Configurations

### Vite

Since I use Vite in other projects, I use for my frontend mentor challenges as well.
It might sound like overkill, but it includes a bunch of good features for locally running
and building. This configurations already includes the vue plugin and initial files
(if you are not using Vue, just delete the files, vite won't deploy
any Vue code if you don't use it),

### `.nojekkyl`

This files stops Github pages from trying to use Jekyll to build the site.

### Linting, formatting and validation configs.

- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.stylelintrc.json`
- `.prettierrc.json`

These configuration files include default rules plus:

- Double quotes;
- Explicit closing tag for void elements;
- Closing brackets on the same line for HTML;
- Not using degrees in `hsl` functions.
